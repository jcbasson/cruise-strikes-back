## Notes

- I used inline styles for rapid prototyping, I am use to using styled components but I want to move over to Tailwind which I would use going forward for production.
- I just wrote some tests to show case that I can writes, normally I would implement 100% coverage.
- I kept the app functionality simple, I tried to implement pagination but noticed the graphql query did not allow for a "limit" parameter.
- The app is styled for desktop with basic styling, if I was given a responsive design I would have implemented it. I can showcase other projects where I have implemented mobile design following the "mobile first design" approach.
